# MindPiano


"An increasing amount of scientific evidence indicates that rhythm stimulates and organizes a person's muscle responses and helps people with neuromuscular disorders"

Created by a disabled artist and programmer this is the first handicap enabled piano simulator. I made this app for people like my Grandpa Charile who spent their lives playing music and found immense joy in it, but sadly, as time went by, his disability took his ability to control his arms and hands enough to play piano. Bring the music back to your life. Requires use of NeuroSky MindWave Mobile or NeuroSky MindWave Mobile Plus headset in order to create music from brain waves and eye blinks. Simply focus on an object an as your focus increases the highlighted note will move up the scale. Then, when you blink your eyes, the app will play the intended note. Simply look away or relax to bring the selected note downwards. Featuring a high quality and realistic piano synthesizer.
